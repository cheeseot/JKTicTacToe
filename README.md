# JKTicTacToe
This is a simple client server based tic tac toe program built by two networking students

Current plans include total GUI frontend to edit settings such as server. Client is pretty dumb but will disable buttons when they are unavailable or the game is on the other player's turn
Server determines x or o, does error checking, and is the relay for updated game tables
